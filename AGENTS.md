# AGENTS.md — civitai CLI

Guidance for AI coding agents (Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Claude Code, …)
and human contributors. This is the **single source of truth** for stack,
conventions, the release process, and the few decisions that look wrong but are
intentional. For user-facing docs see [`README.md`](README.md); for the
contributor checklist see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Stack (exact versions — don't assume training-data defaults)

- **Go 1.25+** (`go.mod` says `go 1.25.0`). Single-binary CLI, no CGO
  (`CGO_ENABLED=0`).
- **Cobra v1.8.1** (command tree) + **Viper v1.19.0** (config), in the
  `gh` / `kubectl` / `stripe` mold.
- JSON Schema validation via **santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6**; self-update via
  **minio/selfupdate**. Release tooling: **goreleaser v2**.
- Module path `github.com/civitai/cli`; the executable is `./cmd/civitai`.

## What this is

`civitai` is the Apps authoring CLI. `civitai app` scaffolds a correct
project, validates the manifest against the platform contract, packages it, and
submits it for review. See the README command reference — don't re-derive it.

## Build / test / lint / run (exact commands)

```bash
make build   # -> bin/civitai, version ldflags from `git describe`
make test    # go test ./...
make vet     # go vet ./...
make fmt     # gofmt -s -w .
make lint    # golangci-lint if installed, else falls back to go vet
make ci      # tidy + vet + test + build — mirrors GitHub Actions CI
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `go vet`, `gofmt -s -l .` (must print
nothing), `go test ./...`, `go build ./...` on every push to `main` and every
PR. Run the binary you built with `./bin/civitai <cmd>`; per-package coverage is
`go test ./... -cover`.

## Layout (the non-obvious parts only)

- `cmd/civitai/main.go` — binary entrypoint; injects build version/commit/date.
- `internal/cmd/` — the Cobra tree, **one file per command**, wired in
  `root.go`.
- `internal/{scaffold,validate,pkgzip,manifest,api,config,auth}` — the building
  blocks behind those commands.
- **Module root** (`package cli`, `main.go` + `schema.go`) exists *only* to
  `go:embed` the vendored `schema/` and `examples/`. It is not the executable.

## House conventions (with one real snippet)

Each command is a `newXxxCmd() *cobra.Command` constructor in `internal/cmd`.
Always set `Short`, a useful `Long`, and an `Example`:

```go
func newWhoAmICmd() *cobra.Command {
	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:     "whoami",
		Short:   "Verify your stored API token",
		Long:    `Verify the stored API token … Reads the token from config or CIVITAI_TOKEN.`,
		Example: `  civitai whoami`,
		Args:    cobra.NoArgs,
		RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
			cfg, err := config.Load()
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
			if cfg.Token() == "" {
				// Actionable: tell the user the next command to run.
				return fmt.Errorf("no token configured — run `civitai login` (or set CIVITAI_TOKEN)")
			}
			fmt.Fprintf(cmd.OutOrStdout(), "Logged in as %s\n", /* … */)
			return nil
		},
	}
	return cmd
}
```

- **Errors:** return `error` from `RunE`; lowercase, no trailing punctuation;
  wrap with `%w` when the cause matters. Root sets `SilenceUsage` +
  `SilenceErrors`; `main` prints `Error: …` to stderr with exit 1. **Make errors
  actionable** — name the next command to run.
- **Output:** write to `cmd.OutOrStdout()` / `cmd.ErrOrStderr()`, never bare
  `fmt.Println`, so commands stay testable.
- **Testability:** network/disk seams sit behind small interfaces
  (`api.Submitter`, `api.Verifier`) or take a dir argument, so tests use
  `httptest` + `t.TempDir()` with no live server. New behaviour needs tests that
  cover the **error paths**, not just the happy path.
- **Config:** `~/.config/civitai/config.yaml` (0600, atomic write). Overridable
  by `CIVITAI_TOKEN` / `CIVITAI_BASE_URL`; default base URL `https://civitai.com`.

### Adding a command

1. `internal/cmd/<name>.go` with `func new<Name>Cmd() *cobra.Command` (set
   `Use`, `Short`, `Long`, `Example`, `Args`, `RunE`).
2. Register in `root.go` (`root.AddCommand(...)`) or under a group constructor
   like `newAppCmd` for a subcommand.
3. Add `internal/cmd/<name>_test.go` driving it via `NewRootCmd()` + `SetArgs`,
   or the constructor + `SetOut`/`SetErr` buffers.
4. Keep `make ci` green; update `README.md` (command table + a section).

## Intentional decisions that look wrong (read before "fixing")

Items 1–3 are deliberate mirrors of the platform (item 4 is a deliberate
*non*-mirror). The durable fix for the mirroring is a server-side
`civitai app validate` endpoint that calls the real `BlockManifestValidator` —
until that exists, vendoring is on purpose.

1. **`civitai app validate` is a best-effort LOCAL mirror, not the authority.**
   The server-side `BlockManifestValidator`
   (`civitai/civitai → src/server/services/block-manifest-validator.service.ts`)
   is the source of truth at review time. The vendored
   `schema/app-block.manifest.schema.json` covers only **syntactic** rules; the
   **semantic** rules the schema can't express (sandbox trust-tier allowlist,
   `page ⇒ iframe`, required iframe sub-fields, the `renderMode` tier gate,
   `targets[].slotId` registry membership) are **ported into Go** in
   `internal/validate/{semantic.go,targets.go}`. Some checks are *deliberately
   not* reproduced locally (origin-binding, scope⊆client) because they need
   per-app server state the CLI can't see — this fidelity split is intentional,
   not a missing feature.
2. **The slot registry is VENDORED, not imported.** `internal/validate/targets.go`
   hard-codes `vendoredSlotIDs` (4 entries) mirroring
   `civitai/civitai → src/shared/constants/slot-registry.ts`. Go can't import the
   TS registry; the set is small and historically stable, so vendoring is cheap.
3. **The lockfile check in `internal/validate/lockfile.go` mirrors the PLATFORM
   BUILD RECIPE, not `BlockManifestValidator`.** It is the one build-time rule
   `validate` reproduces, because the platform build installs *strictly* from the
   committed lockfile (no registry re-resolve fallback) and a mismatch surfaces
   only as an opaque server-side "build failed". The recipe derives the package
   manager from the **first word** of `buildCommand` and requires that manager's
   lockfile; `npm`, `vite`, `npx` and an omitted `buildCommand` all take the npm
   branch. Keep `packageManagerFor` in lockstep with the recipe if the recipe's
   `case` arms ever change, and keep the remedy text mentioning `outputDir` — the
   schema's `allOf` requires it whenever `buildCommand` is set, so a remedy that
   omits it walks the author into a second failure. It fires only when
   `package.json` exists; static blocks never install and must never be flagged.
4. **The CLI does NOT vendor the server's token-scope bitmask — and shouldn't.**
   The `whoami` / `dev-token` "can spend Buzz" capability check decodes the JWT
   `scopes` (a **string array**) and looks for the `ai:write:budgeted` scope
   string (see `tokenCanSpend` in `internal/cmd/app_dev_token.go`). It does NOT
   reproduce the server's numeric scope bit positions — all bit/scope authority
   stays server-side. Don't "helpfully" add a vendored bitmask; the string check
   is deliberate.

**When you change a validation rule, keep both vendored mirrors (`schema/` + the
ported Go checks in `internal/validate/`, including the slot registry) in sync
with the server, and update `examples_test.go` (asserts shipped examples
validate clean) + the README.**

## Permission boundaries

✅ **Always**
- Run `make ci` (or `go build ./... && go test ./... && go vet ./... && gofmt -s -l .`) before claiming done; CI runs the same.
- Add tests for new behaviour, covering error paths.
- Write output via `cmd.OutOrStdout()`/`cmd.ErrOrStderr()` and make returned errors actionable.
- Use conventional-commit subjects (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`test:`/`chore:`); the changelog filters on them.

⚠️ **Ask first**
- Editing a vendored mirror (`schema/`, `internal/validate/targets.go` slot ids) — confirm it matches the server constants in `civitai/civitai` before changing.
- Changing `.goreleaser.yaml`, `.github/workflows/*`, or anything that affects the published binary or the Homebrew tap.
- Adding a new third-party dependency (this is a small, focused project).

🚫 **Never**
- Tag a release or push a `v*` tag without the maintainer (that triggers goreleaser → GitHub Release + tap push).
- Use bare `fmt.Println` for command output, or commit with `gofmt` diffs.
- Treat local `civitai app validate` as authoritative — the server is.

## Release process (maintainers)

Releases are built by **goreleaser** from a GitHub Actions workflow on a `v*`
tag push. With `main` green: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`.
`.github/workflows/release.yml` cross-compiles linux/darwin/windows ×
amd64/arm64 (no windows/arm64), stamps version/commit/date ldflags, produces
archives + `checksums.txt`, creates the GitHub Release (**`draft: true`** —
publish manually after sanity-checking artifacts), and updates the **Homebrew
cask** in `civitai/homebrew-tap` (goreleaser v2 uses `homebrew_casks:`, not the
old `brews:`; needs the `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret with write to the
tap). Validate config without releasing: `goreleaser check` and
`goreleaser release --snapshot --clean` (dry-run into `./dist`).
