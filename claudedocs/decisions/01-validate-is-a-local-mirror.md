# AGENTS.md item 1 — civitai app validate is a best-effort LOCAL mirror, not the authority

Evidence for item 1 of the *Intentional decisions that look wrong* list in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). AGENTS.md carries only this item's TRIGGER —
one line naming the situations that mean you should be reading this file.
Everything below the rule is the item itself, moved here VERBATIM: the thesis,
the measurements, the mutation matrices, the retractions and the enumerated
residuals, consulted when editing the code they are about rather than on every
session.

The list is append-only and never renumbered, so this file's number is stable.
Edit the body here, not in AGENTS.md; `agents_evidence_test.go` asserts the
pointer and the file agree, `agents_trigger_test.go` asserts the trigger is a
routing question rather than a label, and `agents_split_preserved_test.go` pins
the body against the text it was moved from.

1. **`civitai app validate` is a best-effort LOCAL mirror, not the authority.**
   The server-side `BlockManifestValidator`
   (`civitai/civitai → src/server/services/block-manifest-validator.service.ts`)
   is the source of truth at review time. The vendored
   `schema/app-block.manifest.schema.json` covers only **syntactic** rules; the
   **semantic** rules the schema can't express (sandbox trust-tier allowlist,
   `page ⇒ iframe`, required iframe sub-fields, the `renderMode` tier gate,
   `targets[].slotId` registry membership) are **ported into Go** in
   `internal/validate/{semantic.go,targets.go}`. Some checks are *deliberately
   not* reproduced locally (origin-binding, scope⊆client) because they need
   per-app server state the CLI can't see — this fidelity split is intentional,
   not a missing feature.
