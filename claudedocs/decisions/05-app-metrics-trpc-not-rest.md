# AGENTS.md item 5 — civitai app metrics calls tRPC, not REST — because there is no REST route

Evidence for item 5 of the *Intentional decisions that look wrong* list in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). AGENTS.md carries only this item's TRIGGER —
one line naming the situations that mean you should be reading this file.
Everything below the rule is the item itself, moved here VERBATIM: the thesis,
the measurements, the mutation matrices, the retractions and the enumerated
residuals, consulted when editing the code they are about rather than on every
session.

The list is append-only and never renumbered, so this file's number is stable.
Edit the body here, not in AGENTS.md; `agents_evidence_test.go` asserts the
pointer and the file agree, `agents_trigger_test.go` asserts the trigger is a
routing question rather than a label, and `agents_split_preserved_test.go` pins
the body against the text it was moved from.

5. **`civitai app metrics` calls tRPC, not REST — because there is no REST route
   to call.** Owner analytics exist only as `blocks.getMyAppAnalytics`
   (`civitai/civitai → src/server/routers/blocks.router.ts`); there is no
   `/api/v1` equivalent. So `internal/cmd/app_metrics.go` resolves `<slug>` →
   `appBlockId` through the *existing REST* route `GET /api/v1/blocks/submissions`
   and then issues the non-batched tRPC GET in `internal/appapi/analytics.go`
   (input rides in `?input={"json":{…}}`, success unwraps `result.data.json`),
   reusing the `authedDo` + envelope-unwrap pattern `GetForgejoCloneInfo` already
   established. The two-hop shape is deliberate, not an oversight — don't "fix"
   the tRPC call into a REST call that does not exist.
