# AGENTS.md item 8 — app metrics prints RAW endpoint/scope tokens, and the web deliberately does

Evidence for item 8 of the *Intentional decisions that look wrong* list in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). AGENTS.md carries only this item's TRIGGER —
one line naming the situations that mean you should be reading this file.
Everything below the rule is the item itself, moved here VERBATIM: the thesis,
the measurements, the mutation matrices, the retractions and the enumerated
residuals, consulted when editing the code they are about rather than on every
session.

The list is append-only and never renumbered, so this file's number is stable.
Edit the body here, not in AGENTS.md; `agents_evidence_test.go` asserts the
pointer and the file agree, `agents_trigger_test.go` asserts the trigger is a
routing question rather than a label, and `agents_split_preserved_test.go` pins
the body against the text it was moved from.

8. **`app metrics` prints RAW endpoint/scope tokens, and the web deliberately does
   not — this divergence is on purpose.** The web analytics panel humanises the
   two "top N" rollups (`civitai/civitai → src/components/AppBlocks/`
   `analytics-bucket-labels.ts`), so the same data reads as `Generations` /
   `AI workflow submits` there and as `workflow:submit` / `ai:write:budgeted`
   here (`app_metrics.go`, the `Top endpoints` / `Top scopes` sections). That was
   a **deliberate non-mirror**, decided when the web labels landed: reproducing
   them would add a FIFTH vendored mapping to keep in lockstep with the server
   (alongside `schema/`, the slot registry, item 10's dev-tunnel dotenv mirror
   and item 11's ready-ack emitter), and unlike those four it buys no
   correctness — a raw token is accurate, just terse, and the values are already
   bounded so they aggregate readably. The raw form is arguably *better* for the
   CLI's scripting audience, and `--json` must keep emitting raw tokens
   regardless. 🔴 The count was stale and read "a THIRD … (alongside `schema/`
   and the slot registry)": this item predates items 10 and 11, and neither
   recounted it. Four is the number the closing paragraph and both of those
   items already state — check it there before quoting it here again.
   Cost to know about: an author reading the same range on both surfaces sees two
   vocabularies, and a legacy pre-bounding row shows here as
   `workflow:submit:<id>` where the web shows `Generations (<id>)`. If you decide
   to close the gap, mirror `analytics-bucket-labels.ts` wholesale rather than
   hand-rolling labels, add a drift check against the server's
   `recordScopeInvocation` call sites, and note that `pending` is a "no id
   captured" sentinel — **not** a status.
