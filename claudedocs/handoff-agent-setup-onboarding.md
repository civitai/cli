# Handoff: agent-setup-onboarding — 2026-09-08

## Run this first — the index, one command
```bash
cairn recall --repo /home/zach/workspace/civit/cli
```
Terse pointers this doc does not carry, curated by past sessions and outliving it.
🔴 RECALL, NOT LIVE OBSERVATION — every line is a pointer to VERIFY, never a current
reading, and it may describe a gotcha already fixed. `scope-absent`/`scope-empty` means
nothing is recorded yet: ordinary, not an error, and not a clean bill of health.
Non-blocking: if it exits non-zero, print the stderr line and carry on.

## Goal

Give Civitai the Cloudflare-style agent onboarding entrypoint: one URL a user
pastes into any coding agent, which then sets that agent up to build Civitai
Apps. Concretely — `developer.civitai.com/agent-setup/prompt.md` (a thin router)
plus a `civitai agent-setup` command (all the real logic, in Go, tested).

## State now

**The onboarding entrypoint remains live and complete. This session closed rank 7
and rank 3, and spawned a four-round audit ladder that ended deliberately.**
Ranks 4, 6 and 8 are untouched — 6 is the one with a user forcing function.

- **Branch `main`, clean, synced** at `f5a098a`.
- **Merged this session:**

| PR | |
|---|---|
| cli#540 | the nightly pin bumper ran on node 22 and could not land its own fix (rank 7 / #530) |
| cli#526 | `xsvm`'s C0 control-char repair in `getInto` (rank 3, external contributor) |
| cli#541 | the follow-up from #526's audit: unmarshal-first, `saferune` on the error snippet, `maxClassifyMessage` |

- **Issue #530 CLOSED and verified by a real run**, not by reasoning — see the
  RESOLVED block below.
- **Filed, not fixed:** cli#542, cli#543. Cross-linked to the pre-existing #399,
  which is the same family on the other side of the seam.
- **Claim released:** `agent-setup-onboarding-7`.
- **Recorded in the subsystem index** (`cli/scaffold`): the 2026-09-08 `OPEN:`
  bullet rewritten as `RESOLVED 5557b6a`, plus a new bullet for the
  sibling-workflow drift class. `cairn-validate --scope cli` → OK 6/6.
- 🔴 **No clawgate task recorded.** `clawgate_handoff.sh resolve` exited 5. Its
  positive control resolved 1 link for another session, so the board is
  reachable — but a wrong session id also answers 200/empty, so this is **not**
  evidence that no task exists.

### Honest limits on what shipped

- 🔴 **cli#541's final fix round received NO adversarial pass.** The ladder was
  ended deliberately (rationale posted on the PR), not because it converged.
- The last round's own residuals are listed under rank 11.

## Open investigations — live diagnosis state

### The repo is frozen: `pins-vs-published` is red on `main` and the bump automation cannot land the fix

- **Symptom + exact repro:** nothing merges in `civitai/cli`. Every PR shows
  `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED`. Reproduce the cause directly:
  ```bash
  cd /home/zach/workspace/civit/cli
  CIVITAI_CHECK_PUBLISHED_PINS=1 go test ./internal/scaffold \
      -run TestScaffoldPinsSatisfyPublished -count=1
  ```
- **Observed (with values):**
  - Guard output, verbatim: `STALE SCAFFOLD PIN — templates/page-money/package.json.tmpl`;
    `@civitai/app-sdk` pinned `^0.37.0` vs published **0.39.0**;
    `@civitai/blocks-react` pinned `^0.46.0` vs published **0.49.0**. Pre-1.0
    caret locks the minor, so neither pin admits the published version.
  - Branch protection: `gh api repos/civitai/cli/branches/main/protection` →
    required contexts `["pins-vs-published","scaffold-currency","build-test","ready-ack-runtime","template-page-vite"]`,
    `enforce_admins: true`, `strict: false`.
  - `bump-scaffold-pins` nightly: **failed 09-06 (34030852777), 09-07
    (34127760960), 09-08 (34224413110)**; last green **09-05 (33962879680)**;
    09-04 also failed.
  - In run 34224413110 the bump itself WORKS — steps 4 `bump stale @civitai/*
    scaffold pins`, 6 `validate — pins now satisfy published (network guard)` and
    7 `validate — full scaffold suite (offline)` all **succeed**. It dies at step
    9 `validate — scaffold builds against the bumped SDK` with:
    `npm error Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')`.
    Step 10 `open PR if pins changed` is therefore **skipped** — which is why no
    bump PR ever appears.
  - The last full `ci.yml` run on `main` (33909583100, 09-04, `d9b4e29`) was
    green on all 8 jobs including `pins-vs-published` — a **stored green with an
    expiry date**, since the guard queries live npm and upstream published after.
- **Ruled out:** that the bump logic is broken — steps 4/6/7 pass, including the
  network guard against the NEW pins. `via: measurement` (`gh run view
  34224413110 --json jobs`, per-step conclusions). · That `pins-vs-published`
  might be a stale/false alarm — the guard was run locally against live npm and
  fails for real. `via: command`. · That this is caused by anything in the
  agent-setup work — it predates it by three days. `via: measurement` (run dates).
- **Leading hypothesis:** an **npm/arborist install crash** on the scaffolded
  app under node 24 / npm 11 (`aebd2fb` moved CI to node 24), NOT a removed or
  renamed SDK export. 🔴 **Issue #524's body says the opposite** — *"Pins were
  rewritten and satisfy npm, but a fresh `civitai app init … --template
  page-money` then failed to install, typecheck or build against them… this is
  the removed/renamed SDK export case, and it is a real upstream break rather
  than a bot bug."* That body is **rewritten by every failing run** and its
  classification contradicts the log line above. Do not adopt it without
  reproducing.
- **Next probe:** reproduce the install locally against the bumped pins, which
  separates the two mechanisms in one command:
  ```bash
  cd $(mktemp -d) && civitai app init probe --template page-money && cd probe
  sed -i 's/\^0\.37\.0/^0.39.0/; s/\^0\.46\.0/^0.49.0/' package.json
  npm install 2>&1 | tail -30      # edgesOut crash here ⇒ npm bug, not an SDK break
  ```
  If it crashes: the fix is an npm pin / `--legacy-peer-deps` in the workflow,
  and the SDK is innocent. If it installs and then a typecheck fails naming a
  missing export: #524 is right and 0.46→0.49 really did break `page-money`.
  Per the `cli/scaffold` cairn entry, the method that clears a `blocks-react`
  bump is `npm pack` both versions and diff `dist/` recursively, reading the
  verdict off `internal/transport`, `internal/liveHost`, `internal/mockHost`,
  `hooks/useBuzzWorkflow`, `hooks/useAppWorkflows` by name.

### `developer.civitai.com` returns 403 to `Python-urllib` — IN FLIGHT, delegated

- **Symptom + exact repro:**
  ```bash
  curl -sI -A 'Python-urllib/3.11' https://developer.civitai.com/ | head -1   # 403
  curl -sI -A 'python-requests/2.31' https://developer.civitai.com/ | head -1 # 200
  ```
- **Observed (with values):** 403 for `Python-urllib/3.11`; 200 for default
  curl, `python-requests`, `ClaudeBot/1.0`, and browsers. Naive agent fetchers
  using urllib are hard-blocked — which breaks the pasted-URL pattern before it
  starts. Separately, per-page `.md` URLs return 200 but with
  `Content-Type: text/plain`, not `text/markdown`.
- **Ruled out:** nothing yet — this was measured, not diagnosed. `via: assumed`
  that it is in `nginx.conf` (the docs repo ships one); the subagent was briefed
  to check there FIRST and to say plainly if it turns out to be upstream in a
  CDN/WAF rather than fake a fix.
- **Leading hypothesis:** a UA denylist in the docs repo's own `nginx.conf`.
- **Next probe:** read the docs PR's report. If it says upstream, the fix is not
  in this repo and needs whoever owns the edge config.

### ✅ RESOLVED — the repo freeze (`pins-vs-published`)

**Closed by cli#529.** Pins bumped to `^0.39.0` / `^0.49.0`; the guard passes and
four queued PRs merged. The diagnosis recorded below was **half right**: the
`edgesOut` crash is real and still open (see below), but issue #524's
classification — *"the removed/renamed SDK export case … a real upstream break"* —
was **wrong**.

- **Ruled out:** that 0.46→0.49 broke the scaffold. Scaffolded page-money,
  hand-bumped, `npm install` → 142 packages rc 0, `typecheck` clean, `build`
  clean. `via: command`
- **Ruled out:** that it was a contract inversion like 0.44's. `npm pack`ed both
  `blocks-react` versions and diffed `dist/` by name: `useBuzzWorkflow` and
  `useAppWorkflows` **byte-identical**; `transport`/`liveHost`/`mockHost` differ
  by **zero removed lines** — purely additive. `via: measurement`
- **Ruled out:** that node 24 was the cause. `template-page-money` and
  `scaffold-currency` scaffold and build against the bumped pins on the same
  node-24 runners and **pass**. `via: measurement`

### 🔴 STILL OPEN — `bump-scaffold-pins` cannot land its own fix (cli#530)

The nightly bumps correctly (steps 4/6/7 green, incl. the network guard against
the NEW pins) then dies at step 9 `validate — scaffold builds against the bumped
SDK` with `npm error Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')`, which
**skips step 10 `open PR if pins changed`**. So no bump PR is ever opened and the
repo re-freezes on its own the next time upstream publishes.

- 🔴 **DIAGNOSED 2026-09-08 — the two hypotheses below this line were BOTH
  WRONG; do not re-derive either.** The cause is that
  `bump-scaffold-pins.yml` still pinned `node-version: "22"` in both its jobs.
  `ci.yml` moved to node 24 in `aebd2fb` (PR #520) **for this exact crash**; the
  sibling nightly was never updated. Measured on a fresh
  `civitai app init … --template page-money` at the pins of the day
  (`@civitai/app-sdk ^0.39.0`, `@civitai/blocks-react ^0.49.0`), a separate
  clean directory per arm:
  - node **22.23.2 / npm 10.9.8** (the runner's exact versions, from the failing
    run log) → `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` exits **1** with
    `npm error Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')`.
  - node **24.19.0 / npm 11.17.0** → install + typecheck + build all exit **0**,
    116 modules transformed.

  Run-date corroboration: green 09-01/02/03/05 (pins already current ⇒ step 9
  skipped by its `if:`), red 09-04/06/07/08 (the bumper changed something ⇒ step 9
  ran).
- ❌ **RETRACTED — "the nightly installs into a tree its own earlier steps just
  rewrote."** Refuted: step 9 scaffolds into a fresh `$RUNNER_TEMP/bump-validate`,
  and the crash reproduces on a fresh scaffold outside CI entirely.
- ❌ **RETRACTED — #524's "a removed/renamed SDK export … a real upstream break
  rather than a bot bug."** That sentence was **generated by this workflow's own
  `classify` job**, not by a human diagnosis, and it was false. The classifier
  has been rewritten to state the measurement and enumerate the causes without
  picking one.
- 🔴 **Independent of the cause:** a step-9 failure should not silently suppress
  step 10. Opening the PR as a draft, or letting its own CI carry the red,
  surfaces the break without taking the repo down. **Done** — the PR step now
  runs under `always()`, downgrading to a draft on a build failure while pins/suite
  failures still withhold it.
- **Closing condition is still the operator's to observe:** a real scheduled run
  that either goes green or fails step 9 and STILL produces a PR. Nothing here
  can run the workflow.

### ⚠ STILL OPEN — `Python-urllib` 403 at the Cloudflare edge

Re-measured after every deploy, unchanged: `Python-urllib/3.11` → **403**
(`error code: 1010`, Browser Integrity Check), `python-requests` / `curl` /
`ClaudeBot` → 200. Case-sensitive and prefix-anchored.

- **Ruled out:** that it is in this repo. The same `nginx.conf` run locally
  returns 200 to the blocked UA, and there is no `_headers`/`_redirects`/
  `wrangler.*` anywhere in the docs repo. `via: measurement`
- **Next step is not a probe:** it needs a Cloudflare dashboard change by someone
  with zone access. Not actionable from a repo.

### ✅ RESOLVED — `bump-scaffold-pins` could not land its own bump (cli#530)

🔴 **SUPERSEDES the "🔴 STILL OPEN — `bump-scaffold-pins` cannot land its own fix"
block above. That block's "Leading hypothesis" and "Next probe" are both WRONG and
must not be run** — the hypothesis it names was refuted, and the probe it suggests
(checking for a reused workspace between steps) investigates a mechanism that does
not exist here.

- **Closed by cli#540** (`5557b6a`), **verified 2026-09-11** by an actual run.
- **Root cause: node 22 / npm 10.** `ci.yml` moved to node 24 in `aebd2fb`
  (cli#520) *for this exact arborist crash*; the sibling nightly was left at
  `node-version: "22"` in **both** jobs.
- **Ruled out — the step-order hypothesis** ("the nightly installs into a tree its
  own earlier steps just rewrote"): step 9 scaffolds into a fresh
  `$RUNNER_TEMP/bump-validate`, and the crash reproduces on a fresh scaffold
  outside CI entirely. `via: measurement`
- **Ruled out — #524's "removed/renamed SDK export … a real upstream break"**:
  that body is generated by this workflow's own `classify` job, and the sentence
  has since been rewritten so it no longer asserts a cause it cannot know.
  `via: measurement`
- **Observed (control pair, same scaffold and pins, fresh dir per arm):**
  node 22.23.2 / npm 10.9.8 → `npm error Cannot read properties of null (reading
  'edgesOut')`, rc **1**. node 24.19.0 / npm 11.17.0 → install + typecheck +
  build clean, rc **0**. `via: command`
- 🔴 **A green scheduled run could NOT have proved this.** Both runs after #540
  merged went green with **steps 6–12 skipped** — pins current ⇒ `detect changes`
  false ⇒ step 9 never executes. Exercised deliberately instead
  ([run 34559798234](https://github.com/civitai/cli/actions/runs/34559798234)):
  step 9 **success**, step 11 **success**, opened PR #546 (closed, branches
  deleted). `via: measurement`

### ⚠ STILL OPEN — `Python-urllib` 403 at the Cloudflare edge

Unchanged this session and **not actionable from a repo**. Needs a Cloudflare
dashboard change by someone with zone access. `via: measurement` (ruled out as
ours: the same `nginx.conf` returns 200 locally to the blocked UA, and there is no
`_headers`/`_redirects`/`wrangler.*` anywhere in the docs repo).

### ✅ RESOLVED — `developer.civitai.com` 403 to `Python-urllib`

🔴 **The block below titled *"returns 403 to `Python-urllib` — IN FLIGHT, delegated"*
is RETIRED. Do NOT run its "Next probe", and do NOT look in `nginx.conf`.** Its
leading hypothesis — *"a UA denylist in the docs repo's own `nginx.conf`"*, tagged
`via: assumed` — is **REFUTED**. The block is left intact above only because a
corrected reading is worth more than a deleted one.

**Root cause: Cloudflare Browser Integrity Check (BIC)**, a zone-level setting on
the `civitai.com` zone. Never the origin, never the docs repo.

- **Symptom + exact repro (now fixed — this reproduces nothing today):**
  ```bash
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -A 'Python-urllib/3.12' \
    https://developer.civitai.com/agent-setup/prompt.md      # was 403, now 200
  ```
- **Observed (with values), measured 2026-09-09 → 2026-09-11:**
  - Cloudflare firewall events (GraphQL `firewallEventsAdaptive`, zone
    `civitai.com`, host `developer.civitai.com`):
    `action=block  source=bic  ruleId=bic` on `/agent-setup/prompt.md` for
    `Python-urllib/3.11`, `Python-urllib/3.12`, `Python-urllib`, `libwww-perl/6.0`.
  - Block body was **17 bytes**, `content-type: text/plain`: `error code: 1010`
    — Cloudflare's BIC error code.
  - The 403 carried **none** of the origin's headers (no `etag`, no
    `x-content-type-options`, no `cf-cache-status`), while the 200 carried all
    three. The request never reached nginx.
  - Zone settings: `browser_check = "on"` (zone-wide, `editable: true`),
    `security_level = "essentially_off"`. BIC is independent of security level.
  - 🔴 **The denylist is exact-string and case-sensitive, and mostly porous:**
    `Python-urllib/3.11` → 403 but `python-urllib/3.11` → **200**;
    `MyAgent (urllib inside)` → 200; `<empty UA>` → **200**; `Wget/1.21`,
    `Go-http-client/1.1`, `node-fetch`, `axios`, `okhttp`, `Mozilla/5.0` → all 200.
    Only `Python-urllib*` and `libwww-perl*` were blocked. Cloudflare publishes no
    list, no versioning and no changelog for it.
- **Ruled out:** that it is in the docs repo's `nginx.conf` — the 403 carries no
  origin headers at all and Cloudflare's own events attribute it to `bic`.
  `via: measurement` · That a WAF **managed** ruleset did it — events name `bic`,
  not a ruleset id, and BIC is a zone product a managed-rules skip cannot reach.
  `via: measurement` · That a **custom** firewall rule did it — all 14 read; none
  matches `urllib`/`libwww`, and the host-scoped ones target `civitai.com` and
  `image.civitai.com` only. `via: command` · That **AI Crawl Control** could fix
  it — it manages known, self-identifying crawlers; `Python-urllib` is neither
  recognised nor verifiable. `via: doc`
  (https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/manage-ai-crawlers/)
- **Resolution:** a **Configuration Rule** on the `civitai.com` zone:
  `(http.host eq "developer.civitai.com")` → `action: set_config`,
  `action_parameters: {"bic": false}`. `browser_check` stays **`on`** zone-wide,
  so `civitai.com` and `image.civitai.com` keep BIC.
- **Verified (content, not just status):** `Python-urllib/3.12` now receives
  byte-identical content to a known-good UA on `/`, `/index.html`, `/llms.txt`,
  `/apps/` and `/agent-setup/prompt.md` — `prompt.md` 6,949 B and `llms.txt`
  13,066 B, `cmp` clean both, `content-type: text/markdown`, origin `etag` present.

## Next steps (ranked)

🔴 **Ranks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are DONE — numbering is preserved deliberately** so any
live `claim-work` slug keeps pointing at the item it was taken for.

1. ~~**Unfreeze `civitai/cli`**~~ — **DONE**, cli#529.
   forcing: none
2. ~~**Land the two draft agent-setup PRs**~~ — **DONE** (cli#528, docs#67).
   forcing: none
3. ~~**PR `civitai/cli#526`**~~ — **DONE**, merged `517fc76`. The "zero CI has ever
   run" and "cannot be synced from here" claims in the old text were both WRONG:
   CI had run on 2026-09-06, and `maintainer_can_modify` was true.
   forcing: none
4. **P2 of the onboarding work**: `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` +
   `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json` with SHA-256 digests, advertised via
   `Link:` headers. Cloudflare ships the artifacts and advertises none; Mintlify
   advertises. Nobody does both. Repo: `civitai/civitai-developer-docs`.
   forcing: none
5. ~~**Delete or gitignore `node_modules/`**~~ — **DONE**, cli#537.
   forcing: none
6. **Example apps are the one named surface with no pointer.** The shipped
   `AGENTS.md` links `/apps/guide/`, `/apps/reference/` and `/llms.txt` — nothing
   reaches the seven example-app repos or `/apps/showcase`. Decide whether the
   block should name them, and where the list lives so it cannot rot. Touches
   `civitai/cli:internal/cmd/agent_setup*.go` and the docs repo.
   forcing: user — it was in the operator's original scope and was never
   explicitly deferred, unlike the API track. **Still true after this session.**
7. ~~**cli#530**~~ — **DONE**, cli#540, verified by run 34559798234.
   forcing: none
8. **A hard byte ceiling on `prompt.md`, enforced by `check-agent-setup.mjs`.**
   2,798 → 6,949 B with nothing measuring the total. Measured failure mode is
   length: a real agent's `WebFetch` returned an LLM summary that dropped the
   install-failure section, both MCP URLs and all of step 5.
   forcing: none
9. **cli#542** — `snippet()`'s "every argument is server bytes" invariant is
   unpinned; the #393 guard (`internal/cmd/safeterm_userinput_test.go:92`) parses
   only `internal/cmd` and matches only `safeTerm(<one arg>)`, so it is blind to
   `pkg/civitai`'s `saferune.Strip`. True today, enforced by nothing. Read with
   cli#399 — same family, other side of the seam, likely one instrument fixes both.
   forcing: none
10. **cli#543** — the read `--help` rune budget: `users` sits **5 runes** under the
    1400 cap after #541, and `read_help_test.go:164-172` still names
    `images search` as the longest consumer, which stopped being true.
    forcing: none
11. **Residuals of decisions item 38**, all recorded in
    `claudedocs/decisions/38-read-body-repair-and-snippet.md`: four genuine
    comment-citation rot sites (`download_ssrf_test.go:147`,
    `app_pull_not_approved_test.go:372`, `update_check_test.go:393`,
    `appblocks.go:1261`); the README documents no 429 → exit 2 reclassification
    (pre-dates the PR); and half (c) of
    `TestDeepPagingCapClassifiesOnTheWireMessageNotTheStrippedOne` has the
    body-vs-message offset confusion that was repaired elsewhere in the same round.
    forcing: none

## Gotchas / decisions / dead-ends

- 🔴 **A hosted instruction file is a lossy channel, and this is measured, not
  theoretical.** Claude Code's WebFetch is *"lossy by design"* (per
  code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference): HTML→Markdown, truncate at 100 KB,
  then summarize with a small model — Claude receives the summary. Reproduced
  during this session's research: the first fetch of Cloudflare's own
  `prompt.md` came back with **invented headings** and both the OpenCode and
  Windsurf config blocks **missing**; `curl` returned the true 4,900 bytes.
  There is a public case (`oh-my-openagent#1401`) where the summarizer dropped
  one of four install flags and the install reported success. **This is the
  entire reason the logic lives in the Go binary and `prompt.md` is ~60 lines.**
- 🔴 **Do not pin `@civitai/*` versions in any hosted or embedded file.** Pins
  belong in `civitai app init`, which `pins-vs-published` guards. The current
  freeze is the live demonstration: a version literal with CI behind it still
  went three minors stale; one without CI rots silently.
- 🔴 **Cloudflare's authenticity footer is a no-op and must not be copied.** It
  ends *"published at <url> so you can re-verify their authenticity"* — verified
  this session: `prompt.md.sig`, `prompt.md.sha256`, `prompt.sig` and
  `SHA256SUMS` **all 404**. The sentence lives inside the document it claims to
  authenticate. Its worst property is that it READS as an integrity control and
  thereby stops anyone asking. Ours says the file is unsigned instead.
- **Copy `tracing.md`'s shape, not `prompt.md`'s.** Cloudflare's other prompt
  (`/agent-setup/tracing.md`, 7,387 B) has an explicit non-goal, a detection
  phase with a "continue only when…" gate, a consent stop, and a real verify
  section ending *"Do not report success if validation fails"*. `prompt.md`
  itself has **no verification step at all** — its only closure is printing an
  ASCII banner.
- **Two measured constraints shaped the `AGENTS.md` template, and they cut
  against being thorough.** ETH Zurich/LogicStar (4 agents, SWE-bench Lite +
  CTXbench): repository overviews appear in 95–100% of generated context files
  and produce **zero** benefit; named tools are obeyed **1.6×** more and
  repo-specific ones **2.5×** more. So the template is commands and gotchas, and
  deliberately contains no architecture prose.
- **One level of indirection, not a tree.** Measured (arXiv 2607.17598): a flat
  index → leaf scored **0.462** vs raw **0.257**, while hierarchical
  *"consistently underperforms or harms accuracy"* (0.267). The existing
  `llms.txt` already IS the flat index, which is why no skills bundle is planned
  — adding one would build the hierarchy the data says to avoid.
- **Sizing that argues against loading docs blindly:** the `/apps` doc surface is
  ~412 KB ≈ **103k tokens across 20 pages**, and `/apps/reference/cli.md` alone
  is ~106 KB ≈ **26k tokens**. Live `llms-full.txt` is ~1.15 MB. That is
  `references/` leaf material, never something to inline.
- **`--track api` refuses with exit 2 rather than falling back to the app
  track.** "Deferred" must not read to an agent as "the API is unsupported".
- **The `authenticated` check is reported but must NOT fail `ok`.** We stop
  before auth on purpose, so a fresh unauthenticated setup is a success. This is
  the easiest thing in the feature to get backwards; it has its own test.
- **The docs base clone was `behind 18`** when this session started. Both
  subagents were briefed to `fetch` and branch from `origin/main` rather than the
  local ref. Check this before any future work there.
- **Cross-repo subagents must NOT get `isolation: "worktree"`** — that flag
  worktrees the CWD's repo, not the one the task names. The docs agent was told
  to run `git -C <docs-repo> worktree add` itself.

### Added 2026-09-09 — from two blind dogfood runs and five audit rounds

- 🔴 **BLIND DOGFOODING BEAT THE AUDIT LADDER, and the reason generalises.** Five
  adversarial rounds on cli#528 found real defects, then converged on auditing
  scaffolding the ladder itself had written (rounds 2 and 3 on docs#67 changed
  **zero** published-payload lines). Two blind runs found **seven** defects the
  ladder structurally could not: every one was a **prose claim that only fails on
  contact with a real environment** — a NixOS npm prefix, a months-old shadowing
  binary, an OAuth token that cannot be exported, a template written against the
  wrong scaffold. An auditor reading a diff cannot see any of those. **When the
  artifact is instructions, dogfood it; do not audit it.**
- 🔴 **The brief that made the dogfood work:** it may work things out from the
  tool's own errors and `--help`, but **not** by reading source. An agent that
  succeeds only because it had privileged context proves nothing. Round 1 caught
  itself about to do this and recorded it as a finding instead.
- 🔴 **"Success measured in an environment the user does not have."** `agent-setup
  --check` returned `ok: true` from inside the agent's shell while `zsh -lic
  'civitai --version'` still printed **0.1.101**. A green check that only holds in
  the checker's own process is the shape to look for.
- 🔴 **MERGED ≠ PUBLISHED ≠ SERVED — three separate claims, each needing its own
  measurement.** `release-npm.yml` reported success while npm still served the old
  version (npm's own log said *"may take a few minutes to become available"*).
  A merge landed while the origin served the previous build. **Poll the consumer.**
- 🔴 **A stale cache can look exactly like a stuck deploy, and three agreeing
  signals were all wrong.** `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`, a cache-busted fetch, and
  an etag encoding the old length (`0x1858` = 6232) together said "the origin has
  not updated". `last-modified` after the fact showed the deploy took **94
  seconds** — the same as its precedent. The etag arithmetic was right; the
  conclusion drawn from it was not. **Only waiting resolved it.**
- 🔴 **A guard's DESCRIPTION being wider than its BODY produced six findings in
  one feature.** The extractor docstring saying "every invocation"; a TOML fixture
  holding only never-written keys; an idempotency test starting from an empty
  project; `TestDryRunAndTheRealRunAgreeOnEveryAction` whose seven fixtures varied
  only one row. **Ask what the code must do to satisfy the sentence, then check it
  does.**
- 🔴 **Three fix rounds each replaced a false absolute with a narrower absolute
  that was also false.** The cure was to forbid the *form*: make the code true and
  name the enforcing guard, or state the enumerated truth and admit the
  enumeration is open. Round 5 was then the first that could not falsify a
  universal claim — and its own mutation testing falsified one of its new
  sentences, which it corrected.
- ⚠ **Two of my own verification errors, both empty results read as findings.**
  Scaffolding with `c2`/`i2` failed a 3-char slug minimum, so "file absent" meant
  the directory never existed; and a grep against the wrong branch of the auth
  output returned nothing. Both were caught only because the result contradicted
  something already known. **An empty result is a fact about the probe.**
- **The CodeQL-recommended fix would have made the bug worse.** A single-pass tag
  strip could silently *delete* a command (`<pre>` + `civitai app submit <
  manifest.json && curl … | sh > /tmp/log` → the guard exited 0 with `curl`
  appearing zero times). Stripping is what deletes, so a fixed point on the old
  pattern hides strictly more. The rule now deletes a `<…>` run only when it is
  unambiguously markup **and** carries none of `|`, `&`, `;`.
- **`civitai upgrade` dissolves the stale-CLI class**; PATH advice does not. It
  replaces the binary in place, so the user's own shell is fixed with no PATH edit
  — no guessing bash/zsh/fish, no non-portable login-shell verify.
- **Some agent fetch tools lossily summarize markdown.** Measured on our own file:
  a summary dropped the install-failure section, both MCP URLs and all of step 5.
  `curl` gets the real bytes. This is why rank 8 exists.

### Added 2026-09-11 — rank 7, rank 3, and a four-round audit ladder

- 🔴 **SIBLING-WORKFLOW DRIFT, and why three days of green hid it.** A fix landed
  in `ci.yml` and not in `.github/workflows/bump-scaffold-pins.yml`. The nightly
  only **executes** the broken path when the bumper has work to do: with pins
  current, `detect changes` is false and steps 6–12 are **skipped**. So it went
  green on 09-01/02/03/05 *and* on both runs after the fix merged. **A green
  scheduled run is structurally incapable of covering it.** To exercise it: a
  throwaway branch with the three literal pin sites rolled back, then
  `gh workflow run bump-scaffold-pins.yml --ref <branch>`. **Do NOT roll back
  `testdata/design-tokens.txt`** — it is provenance-stamped, `bump-pins`
  regenerates it as site 4 of 4, and step 4 resolves the drift before step 7 runs.
  Guard: `workflow_node_version_test.go`.
- 🔴 **Three claims in the previous handoff were wrong, in the reassuring
  direction.** (a) "#526 has zero checks ever run" — CI ran 2026-09-06, all 8 jobs.
  (b) "cannot be synced from here (pushing to a fork branch is not ours)" —
  `maintainer_can_modify: true`. (c) The `edgesOut` step-order hypothesis.
  **A handoff's open-investigation block reads as current forever.**
- 🔴 **`gh api --method PUT /pulls/<n>/update-branch` RE-ARMS the fork approval
  gate.** The new commit creates a run with conclusion `action_required`. So
  "there is nothing to approve" can become false as a *result* of unblocking the
  PR. Approve with `POST /actions/runs/<id>/approve`.
- 🔴 **A monitor that only emits on COMPLETED checks cannot see checks that never
  START.** One sat silent 20 minutes on `total_count: 0` (blocked at the approval
  gate) and exited 0 — indistinguishable from "still running". Emit on stall, on
  the gate re-arming, and on a run ending with no checks recorded.
- 🔴 **`audit-dispatch.py --round N` REFUSES without an `audit-claims` block, and
  the block is what makes a delta round possible.** Briefing auditors "do not
  comment on the PR" is right for findings and **wrong for the claims block** —
  each round then reconstructs context from prose. Post it as an **issue** comment;
  `gh pr view --json comments` cannot see review comments.
- 🔴 **The audit ladder on #541: four rounds, ZERO runtime defects, ~16 unsupported
  claims.** Each round's fixes generated the next round's findings. Ended on the
  stated criterion, not on convergence — rationale posted on the PR, because a
  report that ends on the escape hatch is otherwise indistinguishable from one that
  converged. Across the whole PR only **~25 executable non-test lines**.
- **A guard whose DESCRIPTION is wider than its BODY was the single most common
  finding.** Examples: a ledger advertising rename-safety while substring-matching
  prose; a matrix header asserting "measured, not reasoned" that disagreed with the
  measurement; a positive control folded into a shared counter so one arm could
  never observe a zero.
- ⚠ **My own instruments were wrong three times** — a `grep -c /dev/stdin` that
  reported empty at HEAD and near-total at base; a mutation that edited a *comment*
  quoting `node-version: "24"`; and `$B:AGENTS.md` eaten by zsh's `:A` history
  modifier (brace it: `${B}`). **Validate the instrument before reading its verdict.**
- **`subsystem_touch.py --session` returned `looked-at-nothing`** because every
  edit was made by a subagent in a worktree. `--pr 540,526,541` found the 26 real
  paths. The better a session follows the delegate-and-isolate defaults, the
  blinder that window is.

- 🔴 **A Page Rule target without a trailing `*` matches ONE path.** The first
  attempt at the fix above landed as a Page Rule targeting
  `developer.civitai.com/` (operator `matches`). Result: `/` → 200 while
  `/index.html`, `/llms.txt`, `/apps/` and `/agent-setup/prompt.md` all stayed
  403. It reads as "the rule didn't work"; it worked, on exactly one path. Needs
  `developer.civitai.com/*`.
- 🔴 **Prefer a Configuration Rule over a Page Rule for this class.** Page Rules
  are **(deprecated)**; Cloudflare's BIC page says *"To use this feature on
  specific hostnames—instead of across your entire zone—use a configuration
  rule"*, and Configuration Rules take **precedence over** Page Rules, so keeping
  both makes the interaction ambiguous.
  (https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/)
- 🔴 **`PUT /zones/{z}/rulesets/{id}` REPLACES the entire rules array — and the
  official docs only demonstrate `PUT`.** This zone has 5 other Configuration
  Rules, two of them active `security_level` overrides; following Cloudflare's
  own example verbatim would have silently deleted all five. **Append with
  `POST /zones/{z}/rulesets/{id}/rules`.**
- 🔴 **A Configuration Rule DOES override the zone-level `browser_check`, and no
  Cloudflare doc says so.** Searched: the settings page states a precedence rule
  only for Disable RUM. Confirmed **empirically instead** — `browser_check` reads
  `"on"` while the exempted host serves 200 to a UA that setting blocks. If this
  ever regresses, re-probe rather than re-reading the docs.
- **`set_config` is non-terminating, so within `http_config_settings` LAST MATCH
  WINS.** Position matters if another rule ever sets `bic` for an overlapping host.
- **The `action` field is mandatory and is `set_config`** — a Configuration Rule
  body carrying only `expression` + `action_parameters` 400s.
  (https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/create-api/)
- **Reading Cloudflare state needs four separate token scopes**, and they fail
  differently: Zone Settings read (`9109 Unauthorized`), Config Rules read and
  Page Rules read (`request is not authorized`). 🔴 **A `pagerules` call without
  the scope returns a body whose `.result` is null — read as a count it yields a
  confident `0` for a zone that has 13.** Check `.success` before any count.
- **Related, not done:** Cloudflare's **Markdown for Agents**
  (`"content_converter": true`) sits on the same Configuration Rules surface and
  serves the same "agents fetch our docs" goal; Cloudflare runs it on their own
  docs. Worth its own decision.

## How to verify

The nightly's fix — the ONLY form that actually exercises it:

```bash
cd $(mktemp -d) && git clone --depth 50 git@github.com:civitai/cli.git . && git checkout -b test/rehearse origin/main
sed -i 's/\^0\.39\.0/^0.37.0/g; s/\^0\.49\.0/^0.46.0/g' \
  internal/scaffold/templates/page-money/package.json.tmpl \
  internal/scaffold/templates/page-money/README.md.tmpl \
  internal/scaffold/scaffold_test.go
git commit -am "test: throwaway" && git push -u origin test/rehearse
gh workflow run bump-scaffold-pins.yml --ref test/rehearse -f drill=none
# steps 9 AND 11 must both be success, and a PR must appear. Then close it and
# delete BOTH branches (automation/bump-scaffold-pins and test/rehearse).
```

🔴 A green *scheduled* run proves nothing — confirm steps 6–12 are not `skipped`:

```bash
gh api repos/civitai/cli/actions/runs/<id>/jobs \
  --jq '.jobs[] | select(.name=="bump") | .steps[] | "\(.number) \(.name): \(.conclusion)"'
```

The read-path guards added by #541:

```bash
cd /home/zach/workspace/civit/cli
go test ./pkg/civitai ./internal/cmd -count=1
nix-shell -p golangci-lint --run "make lint"   # make ci does NOT run lint
```

🔴 Read `rc` directly — `$?` after a pipe is the pipe's status. This repo has been
misled by that twice.
